Are you living in China or are you planning on moving here? There are 10 things you should know before coming.

I have lived in China for almost 7 years now and have seen many people come and go. China can be a really great place to learn and to grow, but at the same time many have a rough time when coming.

Through this blog, I hope to help new ones and ones that have been here to enjoy life and integrate into society in the middle kingdom.
